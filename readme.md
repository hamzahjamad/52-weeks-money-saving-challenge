## About 52-weeks-money-saving-challenge Webapp

This is a simple webapp to record your saving. We make saving money activity as a 'challenge' to make it more fun.

## Live Production Site

I host the production and live version in [https://52-weeks-money-saving-challenge.hamzahjamad.com/](https://52-weeks-money-saving-challenge.hamzahjamad.com/) so everyone can use it. üòù I'm not sure what is the appropriate name for the domain, so i just put it the same as the project name. Hopefully it will be useful for everyone.
